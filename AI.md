# AI tools record

## Week 2
- Task, Todo, Event, Deadline classes (Level-4)
- Turn commands into Enums for basic refactoring (A-Enums)
- Thoughts: JDK 17 is pretty old and we don't really use any external libraries so (public) SOTA models can easily one-shot with the exact prompts and examples given.

## Week 3
- Date & Time refactoring + "on" command (Level-8)
- Add JavaDoc and JUnit tests (A-JavaDoc, A-JUnit)
- Find command (Level-9)
- Thoughts: Manually writings Javadocs is a PITA (especially for >600 LoC) so using AI for this probably saved somewhere between 80 and 90 minutes on that alone, and LLMs do that way too well. Unit tests seem pretty solid, not fully robust but I don't really need it to be too robust.
