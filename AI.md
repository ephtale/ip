# AI tools record

## Week 2
- Task, Todo, Event, Deadline classes (Level-4)
- Turn commands into Enums for basic refactoring (A-Enums)
- Thoughts: JDK 17 is pretty old and we don't really use any external libraries so (public) SOTA models can easily one-shot with the exact prompts and examples given.

## Week 3
- Date & Time refactoring + "on" command (Level-8)
- Add JavaDoc and JUnit tests (A-JavaDoc, A-JUnit)
- Find command (Level-9)
- Thoughts: Manually writings Javadocs is a PITA (especially for >600 LoC) so using AI for this probably saved somewhere between 80 and 90 minutes on that alone, and LLMs do that way too well. Unit tests seem pretty solid, not fully robust but I don't really need it to be too robust.

## Week 4
- Updated README.md and CONTRIBUTORS.md

## Week 5
- Added multiple assertions that are safe to assume (A-Assertions)
- Thoughts: Nothing to talk about, just some non-null assertions and formatting assertions.

## Week 6
- Improved upon multiple UI elements such as font size, image size, image crop, name component, etc. (A-BetterGui)
- Handled duplicate tasks with sass (A-MoreErrorHandling)
- Thoughts: Glad this thing can do UI for me since it's always the nitty gritty that takes up time. The duplicate handling was done very well.
